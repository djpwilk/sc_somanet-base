\section app_fwupdate

This application provides the functionality to program our SOMANET nodes through EtherCAT (slave side).
The application runs 2 threads on the COM_TILE.

COM_TILE:

	*Thread: Ethercat Communication Handler
		
		ecat_handler(coe_out, coe_in, eoe_out, eoe_in, eoe_sig, foe_out, foe_in, pdo_out, pdo_in);
		
		We need to run this thread on COM_TILE since this is only tile accessing the ethercat communication module (COM).
	
	*Thread: Firmware update 
	
		firmware_update_loop(p_spi_flash, foe_out, foe_in, sig_1);
		
		We need to run this thread on COM_TILE since it has access to the flash SPI ports.

Dependencies: module_fwupdate module_nodeconfig sc_sncn_ethercat/module_ethercat

Note: Fore both Core C22 module and Core C21 module, COM_TILE is located on CORE 0.
