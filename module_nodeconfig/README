1.	Create nodeconfig.h in your app's top level source directory and
    configure the nodestack, e.g.:

	#define SOMANET_CORE c22
	#define SOMANET_COM ecat
	#define SOMANET_IFM dc900-rev-a
	
	refer to the *.inc files to get a list of supported boards

2.	Include ioports.h in every source file that needs to access I/O ports
